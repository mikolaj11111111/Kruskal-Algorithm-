# Kruskal's Algorithm - Minimum Spanning Tree

## Description
Finds minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm with Union-Find data structure. Uses edge sorting and forest merging approach.

## Features
- Edge-based greedy algorithm
- Forest color tracking system
- Cycle detection and prevention
- Sorted edge processing
- Visual step-by-step forest construction

## Usage
Reads graph from "data.txt" and builds MST by processing edges in weight order, showing forest construction progress.
